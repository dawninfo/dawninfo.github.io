  <li><h5 style="color: #DA70D6">What are Gangs?</h5></li><br>
        On dawn, we have something called Gangs, that follow the theme of the villainous gangs in the games.  These gangs are led by high performing users on the server and they compete with each other to earn Gang Points.  A single season lasts 2 weeks and any points you earn can be redeemed in the gang shop for increasingly better rewards. You can check out all the gang commands with the command <code>/gangs</code>.<br><br>
         <li><h5 style="color: #DA70D6">How do I earn gang points?</h5></li><br>You earn gang points just by winning tours in official rooms.  High performing gangs will earn something called "turf" which is when the gang takes over the room.  Until the turf falls, all gang members earn double points!  But be warned!  If a member of an opposing gang wins a tour, your gang will lose a little bit of control, until the turf falls!  Once turf has fallen, any gang can claim it by winning more tours!
 <br><br><li><h5 style="color: #DA70D6">How do I join a gang?</h5></li><br>Below are the godfathers of all the gangs,check which gang you want to join and talk to them. Capos are also able to recruit people to a gang. Try <code>/gang list</code> out to see members of a specific gang<br><br>

<br><br><li><h5 style="color: #DA70D6">When does a gang season end?</h5></li><br>The gang ladder will reset every 2 weeks.
       <br><br> <li><h5 style="color: #DA70D6">What are the prizes?</h5></li><br>You can find a list of prizes through <a target="_blank" href="dawn-ps.boards.net/thread/124/gang-prize-shop">this link</a>.
    <br><br><li><h5 style="color: #DA70D6">What are the rules?</h5></li><br>Breaking these rules would result in a tour ban that lasts the whole season in all Official Rooms: <br><br>1) No recruiting members from other gangs. This means you CANNOT switch gangs mid-season to join another gang. Recruiters may be held responsible for violating this; it is your duty to make sure that who you invite is not breaking this rule.
      <br><br>2) No inviting bots to a gang
      <br><br>3) A highest contributor may not win 2 successive seasons. The title would be passed to the next highest contributor instead.
       <br><br><li><h5 style="color: #DA70D6">Are there any Gang Policies?</h5></li><br>-Yes! The local police have been actively finding ways to help balance gangs and to promote competition among gangs. <br><br>- The police don't like overpowered gangs and will do whatever they can to stop them! After a gang wins a gang season, there will be a 10% point nerf placed on them for the next gang season. Each consecutive season they win will result in an increase of this nerf by 5%. If the gang loses, the nerf is removed. The nerf percentage is capped at 50%.
