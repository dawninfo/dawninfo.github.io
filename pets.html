  <li><h5 style="color: #5043d9">I. Get started</h5></li>
        <details><summary><f6 style="color:#BB86FC;"><b>1) What are Pets?</b></f6>
      </summary><div class="okay"> Pets are a nice feature available only on Dawn, where you can collect Pokemon, train 
          them and battle with them against either an AI (Battle Tower) or other players, mostly in pet tournaments.  
          Most of them are born in eggs, but you can also win rare pets from special events.


</div><br></details>
        <details><summary><f6 style="color:#BB86FC;"><b>2) How to get your first pet?</b></f6>
      </summary><div class="okay"> Dawn has another nice feature which is experience. A user can gain experience through chatting and battling, then level up. Once you gain a total 2646 exp you level up to 7. It is at level 7 that you unlock pets. You can use the command <code>/exp</code> to check your current exp and level. 

	<br><br><u>Pro tip:</u> battle tower is by far the fastest exp grinding method, and there happens to be a bt mode you can play without having your own pets. If you wish to reach level 7 quickly while getting used to pet battling, you can enter the commands <code>/bt set battlefactory</code> to select that mode, then <code>/bt</code> to battle. You gain 5 exp per opponent per floor won.

	<br><br>Once you are level 7, you can enter the command <code>/pets</code> to access your pet inventory. You will then see a + button. Click on it to receive an egg. The first one is free, each next egg costs 250 monies. 
<br><br><img alt="Image" src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/855076112349921310/1064522233470533692/image.png" style="width: 597px; height: 470px;"></div><br></details>
        <details><summary><f6 style="color:#BB86FC;"><b>3) How to hatch and evolve your pet?</b></f6>
      </summary><div class="okay"> You need to battle again, on Battle Factory if this is your first pet. You need to gain enough experience to match twice the baby’s BST, it then will hatch. You cannot know in advance what is inside your egg, so it is recommended to aim for 980 exp, since the highest BST available in eggs is 490 (Bouffalant). 
	<br>To evolve your pet, it’s the same: you need to gain exp matching twice the evolved form’s BST, it can be up to 1200 if you’re evolving a Gabite, or, if you happen to win a Cosmog (you won’t get it from eggs though), 1360 from Cosmoem to either Solgaleo or Lunala. However, once you gather enough experience, you must open your pet’s sheet and click on its evolution to evolve it.
	<br><u>Note:</u> if your pet has a split evolution (Slowpoke, Eevee…) all its evolved forms will appear on its sheet once it can evolve. You can then choose what to evolve it into. This also works on pets that evolve differently depending on region (Pikachu, Exeggcute, Mime Jr and so on). 

</div><br></details>
        <details><summary><f6 style="color:#BB86FC;"><b>4) What is or is not born in eggs?</b></f6>
      </summary><div class="okay"><span style="background-color: #FF6C00">Ordinary official pets on their base form with a BST lower than 499</span> are born in eggs. That means the likes of Squirtle, Dratini, Miltank, Oranguru, Unown are born in eggs. For some reason Phione is also born in eggs. Manaphy, however, isn’t. The following categories of pets can’t be obtained from eggs:
<br><br>
          Pets born with a BST of 500 or higher, like Scyther or Shuckle ; Legendary or mythical pets (that includes Ultra-Beasts, Meltan, Cosmog) ; unofficial pets (CAP, custom pets, Pokestars, every <span style="background-color: green">Paldean pet temporarily</span>...) ; alternate formes (Stuff like Rotom-Wash, regional formes, aesthetic formes like Sawsbuck-Winter or Shellos-East) ; the Slaking evolution line ; Missingno. Keep in mind that G-Max pets are not aesthetic formes, there actually is something different about them. I’m letting you guess what.
</div><br></details>
        <details><summary><f6 style="color:#BB86FC;"><b>5) Pet characteristics</b></f6>
      </summary><div class="okay"><br><img alt="Image" src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/855076112349921310/1064522579529969674/image.png?width=615&amp;height=588" style="width: 492px; height: 470px;">
    <br><br><u>Name:</u>  Click on it for a shortcut to the pet’s pcp sheet if you have a pcp (explained further into this guide).
<br><br><u>Stats & Boosts:</u>    These are the equivalents of base stats and EVs you would have in regular Pokemon, albeit there is a slight difference.
<br>Typically, the base stat of a Pokemon divided by 2 (rounded up) is the Pets Base Stat of said Pokemon, for instance, Garchomp with base 130 attack will only have 65 base attack in pets. The hp stat is an exception, it is doubled instead of halved. Exceptions from this rule also apply to Pokemon that would have Huge/Pure Power or hold a Light Ball or a Thick Club. In their case, they get a new base ATK (and SPA in Pikachu’s case), which is double the former base, +21.  Boosts are the equivalents of EVs and you can have up to <span style="background-color: #FF6C00">15 of them in a single stat</span>, capping at 50 total boosts. Each boost costs <span style="background-color: #FF6C00">100</span> pet monies.
          <br><br><u>Energy:</u>  This stat is requi#BB86FC to add moves. <span style="background-color: #FF6C00">The total base power of all the moves your pet has must be less than or equal to your energy level</span>. The exception from this, of course, being STATUS MOVES, which require far more energy than a regular move and may have other clauses attached to their use. For example, Counter costs 7500 energy and is single use (also banned from Standard), healing moves cost 2000 and are single use, screens cost 3000, toxic costs 500…
<br><br>Your <code>energy</code> starts at 50, each energy boost adds 50 more energy. The first Energy boost costs 5 pet monies. All following boosts cost 15 pet monies more than the previous one.  You can find a chart with all the energy costs up to 200.000 <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iAxSwo_tmCLf5_F9YU3DH3biXMhvpd-a7heGN3qrG6M/edit#gid=1373896760">here</a>. To calculate the total cost of an energy level, you can also name your energy level x and apply the function <span style="background-color: green">f(x) = 3x²/1000  -  7x/20  +  10</span>.
<br><br>
<u>EvoLock™</u>: A setting to prevent your pet from evolving, for those who specifically like a form. It prevents accidental clicking on the evolution, as well as purpose <code>/command</code> use.

	     <br><br> <u>Select Button</u>: Once your pet <span style="background-color: #FF6C00">has 4 moves or more</span>, ergo is eligible for pet battles, you may select it and it will be one of your battlers. You may select up to 6 pets at a time. They will appear in a green background in your inventory.
<br><br><u>Profile Button</u>: Makes the pet appear on your <code>/profile</code>. It will also mark it with a #261aab background in your inventory, see the Slaking on the first picture. 

	<br><br><u>Shiny Pokemon</u>: There is a <span style="background-color: #FF6C00">1/2048</span> chance of hatching a shiny, a badge may be obtained once you have <span style="background-color: #FF6C00">acquired 5 shiny</span> Pokemon.
      <br><br><u>Move slot(s)</u>: Number move choices you will be given in a battle, moves are <span style="background-color: #FF6C00">randomly selected every turn</span> if you have more moves than move slots. Try having <span style="background-color: #FF6C00">duplicates of the same move</span> in your movepool. Good things may happen. You are allowed as many moves as your energy limit dictates. Each additional slot costs 500 Pet monies (up to 4).
<br><br><u>Release Button</u>: Releases your pet.
          <br><br><u>Legendary and other locked pets</u>: Only obtainable from events or <code>/petbooster</code>. These will be detailed further into this guide.  Also, how on Earth do you even get a Porygon?!!? Porygon eggs can be obtained when some secret (Staff will not tell you) conditions are met.

 </div><br></details>
        <details><summary><f6 style="color:#BB86FC;"><b>6) Monies</b></f6>
      </summary><div class="okay">They are the pet-specific currency. You cannot use it elsewhere. You can get a small amount from the daily draw (with <code>/exp</code>), win large amounts from special events, or grind them. You gain monies by battling with your pets on the battle tower. Earnings progress this way: Base earnings upon winning a regular floor, Base times 10 upon winning a floor that ends with 0. It then progresses depending on where you are:
<br>1 to 9: Base ; 10 base times 10<br>
11 to 19: base times 2 ; 20 base times 20<br>
21 to 29: base times 3 ; 30 base times 30<br>
31 to 39: base times 4 ; 40 base times 40<br>
41 to 49: base times 5 ; 50 base times 50<br>
51 to 59: base times 6 ; 60 base times 60<br>
61 to 69: base times 7 ; 70 base times 70<br>
71 to 79: base times 8 ; 80 base times 80<br>
81 to 89: base times 9; 90 base times 90<br>
91 to 99: base times 10; 100 base times 100<br>
101 to 109: base times 11; 110 base times 110<br>
111 to 119: base times 12; 120 base times 120<br>
121 onwards: 100 monies; 130 and other tenth floors: 1000<br>
<br>The base earning depends on the bt mode: if this is a 1v1-based floor, base will be 8. If 2v2 or 3v3-based, base will be 16. If 4v4 or 5v5-based, base will be 24. If 6v6, base will be 32. The 100 or 1000 monies won from 121 onwards are also multiplied depending on the format, following the same logic.  

</div><br></details>
        <details><summary><f6 style="color:#BB86FC;"><b>7) Megastones</b></f6>
      </summary><div class="okay">Everytime you win a floor that’s a multiple of 10, you have a chance to win a megastone you still don’t have. All megastones are available, including Latiosite, Latiasite and Crucibellite. However, items to Primal-revert Kyogre, Groudon or mega-evolve Rayquaza are locked. 
	<br>To mega-evolve a pet in battle, you must select its mega-evolution in its sheet before battling, like so:
<br><img alt="Image" src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/855076112349921310/1064525296398782514/image.png?width=593&amp;height=588" style="width: 474px; height: 470px;">
    <br><br>
          You will then be able to evolve it anytime during your battle.<br><br><u>Note:</u> You can select mega-evolution for several pets in the same team, that way you can evolve whichever you want depending on your needs. 
<br><u>Note 2:</u> Pets are available in permanent mega form, which allows you to mega-evolve another pet in your team. They are, however, locked and must be won in the same conditions as a legendary. 
</div><br></details><br><br>
        <li><h5 style="color: #5043d9">II. Pet control panel (PCP)</h5></li>
        <details><summary><f6 style="color:#BB86FC;"><b>8) Mass/smart release, sorting</b></f6>
      </summary><div class="okay">	A pet control panel or pcp is a must-have tool for competitive pet users. It gives you many useful options. First ask our staff (mostly ~Hei'an Qingfu or +CB Wolf) to give you one. <span style="background-color: red">Warning:</span> you can only have one account, we will not give your alt an account before deleting your previous one.
  <br><br>You open your pcp with the <code>/pcp</code> command. Then click on the “pet management” button, then scroll down to your name, click on it, you will then end up there:
  <br><br><img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/855076112349921310/1039860425166159892/image.png" width="543" height="297">    
<br><br>This is your overall pcp sheet, with three useful features. The sorting feature allows you to sort your pets within your pcp by your order of choice. For example, you can sort them by energy to have a clear view of all the competitive pets you own, which will help you plan your training.
<br><br>Mass release will help you release all the pets you don’t want, at once. Click on it, you will first see your entire list. Click on all the pets you want to release, confirm. Then, you will see the list of all the pets you selected for release. If there is a pet you clicked on by accident, click on it again to unselect it, repeat until you only see pets you want to release. Confirm, you’ve released these pets.
<br><br>Smart mass release will release all your non-shiny duplicates with 50 energy.

</div><br></details>
        <details><summary><f6 style="color:#BB86FC;"><b>9) Edit your pet: nickname, trading</b></f6>
      </summary><div class="okay">Still on your pcp, click on the pet you want to edit, its sheet opens. You can also click on its name from its inventory sheet as a shortcut (see Pet characteristics). You will end up there:
<br><br><img alt="Image" src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/855076112349921310/1064526115944804423/image.png?width=723&amp;height=587" style="width: 578px; height: 470px;">
<br><br>From here, you can change your pet’s nickname. You will enter a panel with a keyboard, click on the letters to enter your nickname, click “submit” to confirm. 
	<br><u>Note:</u> you cannot change a traded pet’s nickname
</div><br></details>
        <details><summary><f6 style="color:#BB86FC;"><b>10) Edit your pet: mass move addition/removal</b></f6>
      </summary><div class="okay"><br>From the same sheet, you can edit your pet’s moveset, as long as its energy level allows it. “Add moves”: enter the move you want to add and how many copies you want, in this format: <span style="background-color: cyan">Earthquake,55</span> then click “submit”. 
	<br>“Remove moves”: same process.
	<br>“Remove all moves”: clears your moveset.
</div><br></details>
        
        <details><summary><f6 style="color:#BB86FC;"><b>11) Switching from models to sprites: Personal settings
</b></f6>
      </summary><div class="okay"><br><br><img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/855076112349921310/1039864055034298368/image.png" width="539" height="175">
<br><br>As a regular user, you should have access to the last two buttons. One will edit your pets, the other one is personal settings. It helps you choose what’s displayed in your inventory. By default, you get GIF-type models that take time to load and may cause your inventory to crash. You can if you want switch to sprites, which will then look like the screenshot below:
<br><br><img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/855076112349921310/1039864722419351603/image.png?width=393&amp;height=408" width="393" height="408">
          <br><br>
	Setting sprites should #BB86FCuce the rick of crashing upon opening inventory or pcp, since they don’t use data to dance. However, if your connection is weak, you won’t be able to catch ‘em all I’m afraid. 
</div><br></details><br><br>
        <li><h5 style="color: #5043d9">III. Strategy</h5></li>
        
        
         <details><summary><f6 style="color:#BB86FC;"><b>12) Evaluate a pet</b></f6>
      </summary><div class="okay">To determine how good a pet is, you look at these characteristics: <br><br>

For offensive pets<br>
	-Type: amount of weaknesses, rarity of its weaknesses, presence of double weaknesses<br>
	-Learnset: full neutral coverage in three decent to strong moves, one STAB included<br>
	-Stats: ATK or SPA, speed and bulk: high bulk if slow, fast if average to decent bulk<br>
	-Presence of priority moves, other useful moves. <br><br>

Here are a few great offensive pets and why they’re that good.<br><br>

	-Marshadow (banned): Fighting/Ghost, 90 / 125 / 80 / 90 / 90 / 125 BST 600.<br>
	Good defensive typing, four weaknesses but no double. Good ATK, decent to good overall bulk with 90/80/90. Faster than most ghosts and can Shadow Sneak others. Full neutral coverage with both STABs, which means at the same energy level, it will hit harder than a pet that needs three moves. For that reason, it’s easier to set at double or triple power than Garchomp or Slaking. Access to Spectral Thief and Shadow Sneak, access to Drain Punch and Close Combat, all with STAB. To make it short, it’s easy to train and can reach high power easier than most pets, while outspeeding them. Great in teams and 1v1 alike.
<br><br>

	-Garchomp (standard): Dragon/Ground, 108 / 130 / 95 / 80 / 85 / 102 base, <br>
108 / 170 / 115 / 120 / 95 / 92 mega, BST 600 to 700. <br>
	High ATK, good speed, still decent once mega-evolved, good bulk especially if mega that makes it able to withstand an ice move, still watch out for them though as the AI will spam them and eventually freeze you. Access to full neutral coverage in three moves: Outrage and Earthquake, both with STAB, are walled only by Ribombee, Whimsicott, Togekiss and whoever shares their typing. Stone Edge or Iron Head makes Garchomp able to check them. it’s a costly set to raise, but it’s worth the effort. Garchomp-Mega was once banned due to its bulk, atk and coverage combined. Great in teams and 1v1 alike.
<br><br>

	-Melmetal (standard): Steel, 135 / 143 / 143 / 80 / 65 / 34 BST 600.<br>
	High ATK, good bulk overall, high physical bulk, many resistances. Access to Double Iron Bash, which is a STAB 60BP move that hits twice, making it virtually 120 at the cost of 60 energy per copy, which is a huge advantage as this move will take half the energy needed to raise at the same height you would raise the likes of Outrage. This means that, at the same energy level as your average competitive pet, it will hit harder. It also has access to Earthquake to check electric, fire and steel types, that resist DIB. It also checks most water types. Finally, either Thunderpunch or Ice Punch to check Ludicolo, Skarmory, Zapdos, Ho-Oh and Gyarados-like typings, that resist both Earthquake and DIB. Thunderpunch will help you against the likes of Slowbro-Mega and Charizard while Ice Punch will check Garchomp, Salamence and other main threats. Mostly good in teams, but take it seriously in 1v1 too.
<br><br>

	-Golisopod (standard): Bug/Water, 75 / 125 / 140 / 60 / 90 / 40 BST 530<br>
	Good ATK, slow but good bulk overall, no double weaknesses. Access to First Impression as its main STAB with the same priority as Extreme Speed. Liquidation completes a fearsome duomove set with another good STAB and a DEF drop chance. Both moves combined are walled by a few pets such as Keldeo, Giratina, Eternatus, Dialga, Salamence and a few that are less dangerous, but if you really want a third move to check some of them you can learn Throat Chop or Poison Jab. You can also replace First Impression with Leech Life if you put healing over priority.  Mostly good in teams, but take it seriously in 1v1 too.
<br><br>
	-Slowbro (Standard): Water/Psychic, 95 / 75 / 110 / 100 / 80 / 30 base,<br>
95 / 75 / 180 / 130 / 80 / 30 mega, BST 490 to 590. <br>
	Good bulk overall, high physical bulk, good SPA. With access to good STAB moves like Psychic and Scald, but also coverage like Flamethrower or Ice Beam, or even Zap Cannon if you feel lucky, Slowbro-Mega is an offensive pet you will have trouble countering. It doesn’t end here however, as Slowbro can also run a defensive set, with screens, Toxic, Thunder Wave, Slack Off and has the bulk to support it. It can even add Trick Room to the mix to troll the heck out of you. You get it, Slowbro is tough, versatile and unp#BB86FCictable, watch out for it. Mostly good in teams, but take it seriously in 1v1 too.
<br><br>

	-Slaking (banned): Normal, 150 / 160 / 100 / 95 / 65 / 100 BST 670.<br>
	Good bulk overall with high HP to support Double Edge, its main STAB. High ATK, good speed, Slaking has it all. Normal type therefore one weakness, single, and the bulk to take it. Full neutral coverage with Double Edge (that hurts like Hell), Earthquake (for rock and steel types) and Sucker Punch (to check Drifblim, but also the likes of Giratina or Lunala, and Calyrex-Shadow with priority). This pet is god tier, above most legendaries in terms of potential. It hits hard, hits everyone and tanks well. Oh, btw: it has access to Slack Off. That kind of move is rare on offensive sets, but there is one Slaking out there that was crazy enough to stack them.  See also: Regigigas, similar to Slaking without a healing move other than Drain Punch, and Snorlax, good in standard modes for the same reasons minus healing (and with more reasonable stats). Great in 1v1 and teams alike.

<br><br>
Now examples of pets that are good enough to run monomove and not to care about resistances:<br><br>

	-Darmanitan (standard): Fire, 105 / 140 / 55 / 30 / 55 / 95 BST 480.<br>
	Average bulk but enough HP to afford spamming Flare Blitz. That is all it needs: Flare Blitz stack on top of 140 base ATK, with Dynamax to set sun before even hitting, and negate recoil for a turn or two. Fast and strong enough to Leeroy Jenkins your run and survive. If you raise it high enough, even resistances (minus double resistances and Primal-Groudon) won’t be able to stop you. Great in teams and Nuzlocke (because it can Dynamax).
<br><br>

	-Greninja-Ash (banned): Water/Dark, 72 / 145 / 67 / 153 / 71 / 132 BST 510<br>
	Watch out for this thing, even in Anything Goes. All it needs is its high SPA, Water Shuriken spam and enough speed to outdo whatever would try to check it with Mach Punch. At 20,000 energy (borrowed level), it can exceed 75 BP per hit on Water Shuriken plus STAB. A well-trained Ash-Greninja can also reach 105 BP per hit before hitting 40,000 energy, which is deadly to whatever doesn’t resist, but also a threat to single resistances. Thankfully, Golisopod checks it alone with First Impression.

<br><br>

For defensive pets<br>
	-Type: amount of weaknesses, presence of double weaknesses<br>
	-Bulk<br>
	-Healing, passive damage, utility moves<br><br>

Here are a few defensive pets:<br><br>

	-Blissey (standard): Normal, 255 / 10 / 10 / 75 / 135 / 55 BST 540<br>
	The best special wall in the game. Blissey fears no special attacker with its 255/135 special bulk, its access to Softboiled (single use but a well-trained Blissey can learn it several times), Light Screen or Toxic. Don’t attack it specially, it will outstall you. However Blissey can also be used against physical attackers, with a 255/10 physical bulk backed up by Reflect, and this is just standard ruleset. Blissey is also dangerous in an Anything Goes tournament due to its access to Counter, and its unique 255/10 physical bulk makes it the best user of that move. If you want to beat a Blissey in an AG tournament, be sure to OHKO it. Better in teams than solo. 
<br><br>

	-Ferrothorn (standard): Grass/Steel, 74 / 94 / 131 / 54 / 116 / 20 BST 489<br>
	A great lead or second in a team of six. Ferrothorn’s access to Spikes and Stealth Rock will hurt the opponent’s entire team, while its Toxic + Leech Seed combo, combined with a 74/131/116 bulk enables it to outstall enemies, unless they have a fire move. If you include Ferrothorn to your team of six, it’s great at the second slot, with a Garchomp as lead to filter fire type opponents and make sure whatever beats it is stopped by Ferrothorn. Not to use in solo.

      </summary><div class="okay"><br><br><img alt="Image" src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/855076112349921310/1064517713420103730/image.png?width=241&amp;height=587" style="width: 193px; height: 470px;">
<br><br>To set a pet’s stat boosts, all you have to do is click on these #261aab buttons. Each pet can have a maximum of 15 EV in any stat and 50 overall. Each boost costs 100 monies, an entire set then costs 5000. If you have the wrong boosts, you can reset with this #BB86FC button, 5000 monies are easy to gain. 
<br><br>
	There are three main ways to set a pet:<br>
	-Fast attacker: +15 in its main offensive stat, and find good balance between def, spd and speed.<br>
	-Bulky attacker: +15 in its main offensive stat, +15 def, +15 spd, +5 HP. A +15 def/spd will increase its physical/special bulk more than +15 HP because most pets have higher HP than other stats. Unless your pet is Shedinja or Shuckle, don’t max out their HP before maxing out their other stats. Then again, better not play Shedinja at all, 17 max HP will do no good.
	<br>-Defensive: +15 HP, +15 def, +15 spd, the rest into an offensive stat if you give it a damaging move just in case a pet counters your entire stall set, or into speed.

        <details><summary><f6 style="color:#BB86FC;"><b>14) Set your pet: moves and power growth</b></f6>
      </summary><div class="okay">To give your pet a move, click on it on its inventory sheet, or set them using your pcp. A pet needs four moves or more to be eligible for battle, but a pet can learn several times the same move. To understand how it works, you first need to know that, if a pet knows more moves than it has moveslots, it randomly draws moves every turn.
<br>	If a pet knows several times the same move, it can draw them more than once in the same turn. The move then gains approximately 10% of its original base power per extra copy drawn. However, the more copies of the same move your pet knows, the stronger this move gets, even in a single draw. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hbHjv1KYh3RJ3Sa5aGt_GiENMikBke9yaMe-itGfE4U/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">This chart</a> shows how many times a pet must learn a move to reach a certain multiplier, be it with a single draw or a full draw (4 copies in one turn, marked as monomove because you mostly want to know this if you run a monomove set). 
<br><br>
<span style="background-color: red">Warning:</span> the moves aren’t the same between pets and regular Pokemon! Most offensive moves are available, but conditional moves were simplified and their conditions removed (First Impression and Focus Punch never fail, however FP still has negative priority). Moves that take more than one turn are also unavailable, and moves like Bolt Beak do not inflict double damage, as it is a conditional effect. Moves with variable damage such as Return were removed too, and Sto#BB86FC Power will only use a 20BP. 


</div><br></details>
        <details><summary><f6 style="color:#BB86FC;"><b>15) Set your pet: balance your moveset</b></f6>
      </summary><div class="okay">The best offensive pets often have a balanced moveset, especially in 1v1. You need to make sure you have enough neutral coverage, and that the pets in your team check each other’s weaknesses. For one pet, it is important to reach or approach full neutral coverage with three moves, learned repeatedly until they reach the power you want (see chart above). You also need to have good chances to draw each move, to make sure it won’t be missing at the worst moment. You then can either learn all your moves equally, or set a ratio like 2:1:1 or 3:2:2 depending on your reliance on STAB.
 <br><br><u>Example:</u> you have a Garchomp. You want to rely on Outrage, but you are walled by fairy and steel types, so you add Earthquake. Both moves combined are counte#BB86FC by fairy/grass, fairy/bug, steel/flying and fairy/flying, so you add either Iron Head to at least be super effective on fairies with 100% accuracy, which leaves only Skarmory, Celesteela and Corviknight, or Stone Edge for full neutral coverage. You then decide to focus on Outrage as your main STAB, but you can’t neglect the other moves, so for two Outrages, you learn one Earthquake and one Stone Edge, and repeat this set over and over. You will eventually reach 55 copies of Stone Edge, 55 copies of Earthquake and 111 copies of Outrage, which gives you a x2, x2 and x2.5 multiplier respectively.

      </summary><div class="okay">For some pets like Darmanitan, you just want to power up one move to insane heights and spam it. You will then be walled by resistances, but then, you can raise your energy and learn that move until it does enough damage to seriously threaten even resistances. If your move is Flare Blitz, all you need is an energy level of <b>45250</b> to multiply its power by 4, dynamax if you can to raise this power even further beyond and set sun before even hitting and even single resistances will fall, except the bulkiest of them.

      </summary><div class="okay">Battle Tower is the essence of pet battles. You battle an AI and keep going until you lose. You start on floor 1 and try going as high as you can, with the difficulty increasing every 20 floors. You will first encounter low BST pets without any EVs, then it gets harder. You will eventually face legendaries if you make it high enough, and once the AI runs out of BST tiers it just uses the highest one with extra EV. Most bt formats today revolve around 1v1, 3v3 or 6v6 with a few exceptions. You battle in Regular by default, but you can also switch modes by entering <code>/bt set [mode]</code> then enter <code>/bt</code> again to battle. <span style="background-color: red">Warning:</span> each battle is timed 60s per turn.

          <br><br>You can see here a few modes with different rules. Banlist states what is specifically banned, despite belonging to the active ruleset: Tag Team Doubles uses the Standard ruleset, minus Blissey and the rest of the banlist.

Finally format is self-explanatory. However, the main rule of a specific mode, such as Tag Team Doubles, isn’t explained in “details”.

<br><br>
	-Poké Corral (by CBW): 3v3, every move can deliver a Headshot (triple damage), the weaker the move the greater the chance, multi hit moves lose accuracy (gatlings are heavy, arms may be strong but tire easy, you better come have dinner already, mom’s spaghetti). Hosted in 2021.
<br><br>
	-Middle Cup (by CBW): 3v3, intermediary evolutions only, Chansey/Porygon2 are banned. Hosted in 2021.

<br><br>
	-Four Seasons (by CBW): not a meaningful event like the Haunted House or Love Story series, but still a complex one with too many rules to remember, which is why a document listing them all was issued. Every six turns the season switches, and each season has different effects on pets depending on their type. Some are greatly buffed in Winter and can’t stand Summer, some are lazy in Winter, some heal in Spring etc.
<br><br>
	-Haunted House series (by Sparkychild): hosted around Halloween, each Haunted House (four have been hosted so far) has an effect on default floors related to Halloween. There also are bosses on given floors with different abilities, some even require a niche strategy, which is why borrowed pets are allowed. 
<br><br>
	-Ultimate Boss Challenge (by Sparkychild): Ten floors, ten bosses, each has a specific puzzle to solve. Exceptionally high prize on the line, but it ended in 2019. 
<br><br>
	

	-Journey through Kanto (by CBW): Hosted in 2018, 1v1 on default floors, team vs team (number varies) on boss floors, gen1 pets only, no mega. It’s like RBY, but in pets.

As you level up, you will earn 2 stat points, which can be delegated to HP, Atk, Def, SpAtk, SpDef, and Speed in the "Stats" tab in [<code>/volcocruel</code>]. There is no limitations to how many points you can put into one stat.

At certain level thresholds, like level 20, you will unlock abilities, which can be viewed in the "Abilities" tab in [<code>/volcocruel</code>]. Abilties are earned through certain levels, where at level 10 you unlock your specialized ability, and then every twenty levels earns you a new ability, depending on the path you choose. Each ability always costs a maximum of 5000 Dubloons to max out. Paths are split at the first ability you earn: Atk UP, Defense UP, Speed UP. Each path can have up to 5 abilities according to its specialty. Neither tree shares an ability so choose wisely!
  <br><br>
Atk UP's tree is cente#BB86FC around damage. The abilities it has consists of: | Penetrating Tentacles, Penetrating Tentacles II, Sharp Suction Cups, Tentacles and Ink, Triumph, Ultimate Squid, Squid Smarts, Devious Squid, Jet Squid |. Ability information can be searched via [<code>/volcocruel info (Ability name)</code>].
  <br><br>
Defense UP's tree is cente#BB86FC around being bulky and general tankiness. The abilities it has consists of: | Extra Life, HP UP, HP UP II, Heavy Body, Immunity, Lifeline, Ooze Body, Shield, Spiteful Squid, Regeneration | . Ability information can be searched via [<code>/volcocruel info (Ability name)</code>].
  <br><br>
Speed UP's tree is cente#BB86FC around technique and being fast as well. The abilities it has consists of: | Dexterous Tentacles, Graceful Tentacles, Lifeline, Momentum, Prankster, Trickster, Speedy Offense, Dodge UP, Assassin | . Ability information can be searched via [<code>/volcocruel info (Ability name)</code>].
  <br><br>
As a bonus, you may unlock General Abilities along the way, at every 50 levels for a total of 2, which are universal to each build and give little passives. These abilities include: | Dubloons UP, EXP UP, Slimy Skin, Strong Suction Cups, Tentacle Smack, Level UP, Focus Sash, Shed Skin | . Ability information can be searched via [<code>/volcocruel info (Ability name)</code>]. Small NOTE: EXP UP is meant for your Volcocruel, not the EXP you gain for the [<code>/exp</code>] command.
  <br><br>
Your moves have a specific tab in [<code>/volcocruel</code>] labeled "Moves". There, you can level up your moves, each level boosting the power of your move by 1% per level, and at level 20 to every 40 levels after, you can evolve your moves. The levels cap with your Volcocruel pet. The moves per slot change thusly:
  <br><br>
Ember > Mystical Fire > Lava Plume > Fusion Flare > Overheat<br>
Water Gun > Water Pulse > Scald > Steam Eruption > Hydro Cannon<br>
Powder Snow > Freeze Dry > Ice Beam > Ice Burn > Fleur Cannon<br>
Mega Drain > Scorching Sands > Earth Power > Solar Beam > Leaf Storm<br><br>
 
Please note that you cannot devolve your moves!<br><br>
 
If you would like to switch your Volcocruel's specialized build - say you went Speed build but want to try Attack - you can use the [<code>/volcocruel reset</code>] command and everything but your Dubloons will be reset to the very beginning.
 <br><br>
You may also buy EXP, which costs a varying amount of Dubloons which decreases the more you need for each level.
