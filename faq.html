<div class="features">
      <details><summary><f6 style="color:#DA70D6;"><b>What is Dawn?</b></f6>
      </summary><div class="okay">Dawn is a Pokémon Showdown Side Server, much like the Smogon server you're probably
        used to.  Everything here works exactly the same as it does there, plus or minus a few odds and 
        ends (those are explained below)</div><br></details><br>
  <details><summary><f6 style="color:#DA70D6;"><b>Who runs this server?</b></f6>
      </summary><div class="okay">This server's staff is different from Smogon's server's, as this is a separate server. 
    So we have our own staff team here.  Your admins, who all perform different roles from programming to 
    general day to day server stuff, your Global Leaders who more or less assist the admins with the day to day stuff, 
    Global Moderators who are mostly in charge of, well, moderating the server, and Global Drivers who assist with 
    whatever tasks they need to. You can see these staffs (Drivers-Admins) <a href="https://dawnps.glitch.me/auth.html">here</a>. 
    You may also see Global Operators and Global Voices--these users are staff-in-training and have limited moderation powers 
    but still help with things such as running tours. 
</div><br></details><br>
  <details><summary><f6 style="color:#DA70D6;"><b>Tournaments?</b></f6>
      </summary><div class="okay">On Dawn, although the ladder <i>does</i> exist and function exactly the same, 
    outside special events, very few people actually ladder here.  Instead, we host user-voted on tours in almost all 
    the official rooms throughout the day.  These tours happen roughly 2-3 times an hour so don't be upset if 
    you miss one.
</div><br></details><br>
  <details><summary><f6 style="color:#DA70D6;"><b>What are "official rooms?"</b></f6>
      </summary><div class="okay">Official rooms are separated in the room list and are rooms that award server currency,
    or bucks, to anyone who wins a tour said room.  These are also the only rooms that Global Staff will moderate,
    unless specifically called to another room for rule breaking.  These rooms also award gang points to anyone
    who's a member of a gang.  More on this below.
</div><br></details><br>
  <details><summary><f6 style="color:#DA70D6;"><b>What are the rules I have to follow?</b></f6>
      </summary><div class="okay">Dawn's rules don't vary much, if any, from the Smogon's Global Rules (which you can find 
    by using <code>/rules</code> in chat). However, Dawn has some own rules, mostly targetting to prevent the misuse of
    our features. In order to see them, use <code>/dawnrules</code>.

</div><br></details><br>
  <details><summary><f6 style="color:#DA70D6;"><b>How do I get a custom avatar?</b></f6>
      </summary><div class="okay">The ability to request for custom avatars unlocks at level 5 (<code>/requestavatar 
    [link]</code>). You can also buy it from the Server Shop (<code>/shop</code>) for 15 Bucks. <b>Avatar Image must 
    be provided by you. If you don't know how to make one, buy it from rooms who provide avatars for purchase. 
    Avatar size must be 80x80</b>.

</div><br></details><br>
  <details><summary><f6 style="color:#DA70D6;"><b>What's all this on the exp page mean?</b></f6>
      </summary><div class="okay">Custom Avatars are pretty self explanatory.  But the other things, such as Nature,
    Item, Personality, etc are all characteristics you can set, just like in the games.  These characteristics will 
    appear on your user profile.  Check it by typing <code>/profile</code> into the chat.  Additionally, you can check any user's 
    profile by using <code>/profile (username)</code>.  You can also unlock the ability to choose your own profile 
    background and profile music.

</div><br></details><br>
  <details><summary><f6 style="color:#DA70D6;"><b>Custom Titles?  Userlist Icon?  Global Declare Requests?  What are all these?</b></f6>
      </summary><div class="okay">Custom Titles are names that appear in parenthesis after your user name on your profile. 
    This can be almost anything you want, as long as it doesn't break any rules.  A userlist icon is a small image that 
    appears next to your username in the user list.<br>Global Declares are something you can request to send out using 
    HTML to announce your event.  These requests are not to be used to say hello or anything like that. 

</div><br></details><br>
  <details><summary><f6 style="color:#DA70D6;"><b>There's this room called Amity Square and they talk about pets there a lot.
    And I've heard the term pets mentioned a few times.  What is that?</b></f6>
      </summary><div class="okay"> Pets is a mini-simulator built into dawn, coded and maintained by the head developer, 
    ~<font style="color:#BF42DF;">Sparky✿Child</font>. The Pets battle system works quite differently than what you're used 
    to but has a lot of fun modes to play.  You can check <a href="https://dawninfo.github.io/pets.html">this page</a> 
    out for more details about how Pets work.
